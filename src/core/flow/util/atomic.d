   1.  They used to actually contain ASM code and I don' want to have to change
       to directly calling core.atomic in a zillion different places.
   2.  core.atomic has some misc. issues that make my use cases difficult
       without wrapping it.  If I didn't wrap it, casts would be required
       basically everywhere.
