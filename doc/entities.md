# Entities
They exist in an environment made by many entities.
They are contained in a system.

## Aspect
An entity is made from aspects of itself.

An aspect is basically a set of information.
This information can change because of funtionality acting on it.

The fact you have a hand allows possible changes to happen.  
The fact you have a brain allows possible changes to happen.

They might not and most of them won't.
But some will. What change is hopefully up to you.

## Discrete aspects
Discrete means, that it's information has a finite amount of possible changes.
Every information meeting this criteria could be fully pictured in binary.
Fully picturing it in binary means beeing able to change it.

Discrete functionality is the one executed by central processing units(CPU).
At this time they doesn't work continuous just in discrete steps.
However it allows to execute discrete functionality on discrete information.
They might once be able to host continuous information
and even to execute at least a finite amount of continuous functionality on it.

## Continuous aspects
When you bend an arm. The amount of angles you
could change the information to, is it finite?

That angle is just one of many informations making your aspect of having an arm.
So it needs the same amount of what can cause happening change.  
Try it...

What brings you to this very change of that information?
Why exactly that outcome? How can you define the
functionality behind what happened?

Are you even able to picture, so determine the exact difference?

Continuous information obviously is blurry, maybe even uncertain.
Hopefully once we will be able to leave the sample rate and the bit behind us.

## Data
Information allowing certain functionality can be pictured.
A "thing" hosting such a picture is data.
Data might consist of many parts.
The difference is, data might contain additional meta data
bringing the hosted picture into the context of its abstractions base.

## Tick
For a clock the tick is the change of at least one hand's angle.
Even it could be the abstraction of continuous functionality
like the swing of a pendulum it is discrete.
You can define it for the aspect of beeing a clock
as the change of it's hand's information by 360Â°/60 clockwise.

For flow runtime a tick can be any atomic algorithm
written in D and acting on given aspect.

## Causal chain
Ticks can be chained to form a series of changes.
Each tick could act on another aspect of any entity.
This context switch is done by entities interacting.

## Signals
In flow runtime interaction is happening by signals.
It supports the known unicast, anycast and multicast.
