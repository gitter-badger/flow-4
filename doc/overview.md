# Overview

**FLOW** is a framework dedicated to provide intelligence and servicing to **communication network**s consisting of different resources. When speaking about a communication network hosting FLOW, we are speaking of a **heterogenous swarm**. Its dedication is to generate outside and/or self driven functional synergies by containing different acting/reacting entities communicating with each other.

A nice analogue if you saw the movie "Finding Nemo":
There was a scene where Dory asked a swarm of fish specific questions. Since the fish were not able to speak, they answered by reflecting the light in a specific pattern. One fish would never be able to do that, but the whole swarm could successfully answer to that questions. In our case we do not only offer different types of fishes, but allow you to create your own and therefor your own ways for the swarm to answer.

Also this points out how this project was inspired by many different creative sources across the history of modern humanity influencing me and my thoughts. These fact is the best example for how FLOW is supposed to work.

The name FLOW is pointing to the ability of something staying in a functional flow.
