# Overview

**FLOW** is a framework aims to provide intelligence,
servicing and data mining capabilites to communication networks
but also single processes consisting of different resources.
When speaking about a FLOW,
we are speaking about a **heterogenous swarm** driven by **functionality flows**.
Its dedication is to generate outside and/or self driven functional
synergies by containing different acting/reacting entities communicating with each other.

Since this is not achievable using "classic" programming paradigms,
here I want to introduce the, as I call it, **organic programming** paradigm.
A concrete description can be found in the [phil. manifest](https://github.com/RalphBariz/flow/blob/master/doc/philosophy.md).

A nice analogue if you saw the movie "Finding Nemo":
There was a scene where Dory asked a swarm of fish specific questions. Since the fish were not able to speak, they answered by reflecting the light in a specific pattern. One fish would never be able to do that, but the whole swarm could successfully answer to that questions. In our case it does not only offer different types of fishes, but allow you to create your own and therefore your own ways for the swarm to answer.

This points out how this project was inspired by many different
creative sources across the history of modern humanity influencing me and my thoughts.
These fact is the best example for how FLOW is supposed to work.

The name FLOW is pointing to the ability of something staying in a so called flow(stable causal flow of functionality).
