He helped and still helps me a lot with the specs of the project. The discussions with him really helped me to clean and focus my thoughts on this. Also he contributed that wonderful "Finding Nemo" analgue in the [Overview](https://github.com/RalphBariz/flow/blob/master/doc/overview.md)

* **[freenode.org](https://webchat.freenode.net):#D@2016**

The guys there really supported me learning not only D but also to enjoy it.
