`std.digest.digest` was renamed to `std.digest`.

$(B Motivation):

The fully qualified name of the digest function template was `std.digest.digest.digest`.
This is because `std.digest` is a package, with a module named `digest` in it, and the function `digest` inside that.

$(MREF std, digest) contains the former `std.digest.digest` package.
